	<div id="Bio"><p> I am an aspiring UX designer with a background in neuroscience and education. I've learned over the years, you cannot control where life takes you, but you have to learn and enjoy the journey.  I was drawn to study neuroscience at the University of Southern California because of a my twin passions for how things work and social change which transitioned into thinking about social systems in education. Startups in the education sector are transforming the learning experience for everyone of every age, and that energy of impactful change drives me. From the age of 10, I have been blogging, and that desire to match my personality with the look and feel of my websites manifested in learning to hack code and templates to mix-and-match what suited my needs. I have always loved coding and creating communities, and am excited to blend my talents and passions together in a meaningful career. </p> </div>
